      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Precious Ezinne Ezeogu,i hail from Imo state, I live and work
        in Lagos,i recently got my B.SC in Human Anatomy.in a state of after
        school confusion and finding myself i was presented an oopurtunity from
        a friend of mine who has been in the tech space for awhile;to apply for
        the Genesys 2024 upskill program which i did , during the application
        process i intially was met with a dilema of mmaking a choice between
        Product DESIGN and Web Development,because i had zero background
        knowledge on both of them i couldnt even differentiate the difference
        between front end and back end development all i knew was i wanted to
        advance in a tech skill i was intrested in so i did my basic research on
        either options and my fascination for the behind scenes magic and the
        colour manipilation and arrangment of coding drew to make a perfect
        conclusion to make this upskill programm my stepping stone into the
        mastering of programming languages.

          My Learning and Self Discovery Journey In The Genesys Upskill 2024 Web
          Development Program
        </h3>
        <p>
          As with learning anything new,one is always faced with challenges and
          initial confusions and setbacks. <br />
          which i did face, but with the help of the ever amazing facilitatiors
          who were always ever ready to offer their guidance and mentorship i
          was gradually able finally find my around it. <br />
          suddenly the almighty HTML wasnt so mighty anymore. Now i am able to
          not only download vs code but to effectively use it in running basic
          code, i am also able to create an HTML document, a boilerplate, how to
          import and work along side an image using the
          <strong>img</strong> tag, i also learnt the use of other basic HTML
          element like the <strong>p</strong> tag for paragraph. which i am
          actively impelementing here,i amm also to create a funtional and
          userfriendly form using basic html tags like the select
          button,optgroup tag,optio tag, input tag,label tag. <br />
          I am also able to differentiate between odered list
          <strong>ol</strong> and unodered list <strong>ul</strong> and how to
          properly use their tags effectively. <br />
          Lastly I also learnt how to link two HTML file together and link them
          properly how to create a clickable link to a funtioning absolute URL
          using the anchor tag <strong>a</strong>. <br />
          Of course, i know these are just the basics but a few weeks agos they
          felt foreign they felt foreign;like an unmoveable moutain but look at
          where we are now taking each learning and discovery process one tag at
          a time.

            >QUESTION: What distinguishes normal HTML elements from semantic
            HTML elements?</strong
          >
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>ANSWER:</strong>What differentiate a normal html element from
          a semantic HTML elements is the extra information semantic elements
          provide and its specificity which aid better search engine
          optimization;making it eaily readable and accessible for users.Aside
          from the extra information and specificity in search engine
          optimization that semantic HTML tags provides,its also aids in
          readabilty for people with special needs who would be using different
          software programs to access your sites. <br> <strong>EXAMPLES OF SEMANTIC TAGS:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Header</strong></li>
            <li> <strong>Nav</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Main</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Footer</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Aside</strong></li>

            QUESTION:Explain the disparity between closing tags and self-closing
            tags in HTML?
          </strong>
          <br />
          <br>
          <strong>ANSWER:</strong> The major disparity between a self closing tag and a closing tag in HTML as its conoted by the name is that
           self-closing HTML tag does not need to be closed manually by its closing tag,while a closing tag has a separate closing tag for 
           itself.
           Here are  some examples of self-closing and closing tags; <br> <strong> EXAMPLES OF SELF-CLOSING TAGS : </strong> <br>
           <ul>
            <li>
              The <strong> br</strong> tag
            </li>
            <li>The  <strong>img</strong> tag </li>
            <li>The <strong>hr</strong> tag </li> 
            <li> The <strong>input</strong> tag
            <br>etc....</li>
           </ul>
           <br>
          
           <strong>EXAMPLES OF CLOSING TAGS:</strong>
           <Ul>
            <li> The <strong>body</strong> tag</li>
            <li> The <strong>anchor (a)</strong> tag</li>
            <li>The <strong>main</strong> tag <br>etc...</li>
           </Ul>
           <br> <strong> QUESTION:What distinguishes inline elements from block elements in HTML?</strong>
           <br>
           <br> <strong> ANSWER:</strong>
           
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>
      Block Elements:
    </th>
    <th>
      Inline Elements:
    </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Block elements occupy occupy the full width irrespective of their sufficiency  </td>
      <td>
      Inline elements only cover the width according to the size of bounded tags in the HTML element.
      </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Block elements always start in a line
    </td>
    <td>
      Inline elements don't start in a new line.
